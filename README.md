### Hey! 👋

My name is Anna and I’m passionate about spatial data science, machine learning, and maps. My favorite tools are R, Shiny, and Python, but I also work in ArcGIS, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

I'm pursuing a [Master of Urban Spatial Analytics](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about) at the University of Pennsylvania's Weitzman School of Design, where I serve as teaching assistant for the graduate-level Public Policy Analytics course. I am also a data scientist at a NYC tech startup. Previously, I worked at the Housing Initiative at Penn, where I got to build [dashboards](https://housinginitiative.shinyapps.io/PHFA_Housing_Dashboard/) and webmaps about affordable housing.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to talk to LLMs using Python libraries including Langchain
- 💬 Ask me about data visualization with R libraries
- 🏈 Currently building: a [dashboard](https://annaduan09.github.io/penn-football-testing-dashboard/) to help Penn Football evaluate and understand their athletes' performance
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Pennsylvania [state recordholder](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/annaduan) in powerlifting!
