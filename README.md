### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a spatial data science grad student and a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. Iâ€™m passionate about data viz and spatial analytics, and love a good map. R, Shiny, and Python are my favorites, but I also work in ArcGIS, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and the Adobe suite.

I'm currently pursuing a Master of Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania's Weitzman School of Design, and I am the teaching assistant for Public Policy Analytics, one of the program's core classes.

I am also a Research Analyst at the Housing Initiative at Penn, where I study the equity implications of affordable housing policy and [Emergency Rental Assistance.](https://www.housinginitiative.org/rent-debt-and-tenant-vulnerability-in-los-angeles.html)
